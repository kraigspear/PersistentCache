## Architecture Overview

This Swift package implements a thread-safe memory cache with automatic eviction and disk persistence. The cache leverages NSCache for memory management, which provides system-integrated eviction policies based on available memory rather than strict LRU behavior.

### Core Components

1. **MemoryCache** (`Sources/PersistentCache/MemoryCache.swift`)
   - Actor-based thread-safe implementation
   - Built on NSCache for automatic memory management
   - NSCache handles eviction based on system memory pressure
   - Automatic eviction when memory is needed by the system
   - Integration with DiskCache for persistence

2. **DiskCache** (Private nested class in `MemoryCache+DiskCache.swift`)
   - Persistent storage in `~/Library/Caches/DiskCache-{identifier}/`
   - SHA256-based file naming for cache keys
   - Automatic cleanup of files older than 1 hour (optimized for radar images)
   - Time-based cleanup triggers every 30 minutes
   - Asynchronous cleanup to avoid blocking write operations

3. **CachedValue Protocol**
   - Requires `cost: Int` property for memory management
   - Requires `data: Data` property for serialization
   - Requires `fromData(data:) throws -> Self` for deserialization

### Key Design Patterns

- **Actor Pattern**: Both caches use Swift actors for thread safety
- **NSCache Foundation**: Leverages NSCache's built-in memory management and eviction policies
- **Memory Pressure Handling**: NSCache automatically responds to system memory warnings
- **System Integration**: NSCache integrates with iOS/macOS memory management systems

### Platform Requirements

- iOS 18.0+
- macOS 15.0+
- Swift 6.0+

## Common Development Tasks

When making changes to the cache implementation:

1. The CachedValue protocol has been extended to support disk persistence - ensure any cached types implement the required `data` property and `fromData` method
2. The tests currently have compilation errors due to protocol conformance - fix these when updating tests
3. Use OSLog for debugging with appropriate log contexts (cache, diskCache, memoryPressure)
4. Performance monitoring is built-in using OSSignposter

## Testing Approach

The package uses Swift Testing framework (@Test attributes). Tests are located in `Tests/PersistentCacheTests/` and cover:
- Basic cache operations (set/get/remove)
- LRU eviction behavior
- Memory pressure handling
- Cost-based eviction
- Edge cases and error handling
- Disk cache persistence

## Documentation Standards

When documenting code in this project, follow these guidelines:

### Code Comments
- **Focus on WHY, not HOW**: Comments should explain the reasoning behind decisions, not describe what the code does
- **Examples**:
  ```swift
  // BAD: Increment the counter by 1
  counter += 1
  
  // GOOD: Reset counter after cleanup to track next batch
  counter = 0
  ```

### DocC Documentation
- **Document all public interfaces**: Every public type, method, and property needs DocC comments
- **Document internal interfaces**: Internal APIs should also have DocC comments for team clarity
- **Format**:
  ```swift
  /// Brief description of what this does.
  ///
  /// More detailed explanation if needed, including usage context
  /// and important considerations.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - param1: What this parameter represents and constraints
  ///   - param2: What this parameter represents and constraints
  /// - Returns: What is returned and in what cases
  /// - Throws: What errors can be thrown and when
  ```

### What NOT to Document
- Private implementation details that are self-evident
- Obvious code that speaks for itself
- Standard Swift patterns that any Swift developer would understand

## Code Review
- A Philosophy of Software Design is a guiding principle
- We want to follow Apple's guidance on how they write code
- We want testable code, but we also favor simplicity and readability
