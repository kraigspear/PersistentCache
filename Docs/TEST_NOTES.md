# Test Coverage Notes

This document provides detailed information about test coverage for the PersistentCache project, including what is tested, what isn't tested (and why), and recommendations for future testing improvements.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach focuses on:
1. **Testing our code**, not Apple's frameworks
2. **Realistic scenarios** over edge cases we can't control
3. **Verifiable behavior** rather than implementation details
4. **Maintainable tests** that don't rely on platform-specific behavior

## ✅ What We Test

### 1. Core Cache Operations
- **Basic CRUD**: Set, get, contains operations
- **Disk fallback**: Automatic loading from disk when not in memory
- **Data persistence**: Values persist to disk within same instance
- **Overwrite behavior**: Updating existing keys

### 2. Concurrency
- **Parallel reads**: 100+ concurrent read operations
- **Parallel writes**: Multiple threads writing different keys
- **Mixed operations**: Concurrent reads, writes, and contains checks
- **Race conditions**: Same key updates from multiple threads

### 3. Data Protocol Conformance
- **Data extension**: Verify Data type works as CachedValue
- **Custom types**: TestCachedValue implementations
- **Serialization**: data property implementation
- **Deserialization**: fromData method implementation

### 4. Error Handling
- **Corrupted files**: Automatic deletion on deserialization failure
- **Invalid data**: Graceful handling of malformed cache files
- **Missing files**: Proper nil returns for non-existent keys

### 5. Disk Persistence (NEW)
- **Cross-instance persistence**: Data survives cache instance destruction
- **Shared storage**: Multiple instances with same identifier share disk
- **Storage isolation**: Different identifiers have separate storage
- **Memory-only contains**: Contains() only checks memory, not disk

### 6. Edge Cases (NEW)
- **Very long keys**: 1000+ character keys work correctly
- **Special identifiers**: Spaces, slashes, dots, etc. in cache identifiers
- **Unicode support**: Emoji and international characters in keys/identifiers
- **Rapid instantiation**: Many instances created/destroyed quickly

## ❌ What We Don't Test (And Why)

### 1. NSCache Behavior
**Not Tested:**
- Memory pressure eviction
- Cache size limits
- Eviction order/strategy

**Rationale:** NSCache is an Apple framework component. Testing its internal behavior would be:
- **Impossible**: No API to trigger eviction predictably
- **Fragile**: Behavior varies by platform and OS version
- **Unnecessary**: We trust Apple's implementation
- **Out of scope**: Not our code to test

### 2. System Integration
**Not Tested:**
- Memory warnings from iOS/macOS
- Disk space exhaustion
- File system permissions
- Network volume behavior

**Rationale:** These require:
- **Special privileges**: Can't easily simulate system conditions
- **Platform-specific code**: Would make tests non-portable
- **External dependencies**: File system state we can't control
- **Flaky tests**: System conditions are unpredictable

### 3. DiskCache (Now Private Implementation Detail)
**Change**: DiskCache is now a private nested class within MemoryCache

**Not Tested:**
- Direct DiskCache operations (it's now private)
- Cleanup functionality (runs on init, deinit, and every 100 writes)
- Directory creation/management
- File-level operations

**Rationale:** 
- **Implementation detail**: DiskCache is now internal to MemoryCache
- **Thread safety**: Guaranteed by MemoryCache actor context
- **No public API**: Cannot be accessed or tested directly
- **Best effort cleanup**: Runs automatically but not critical to test

### 4. Performance Metrics
**Not Tested:**
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Operation timing
- Memory usage tracking

**Rationale:**
- **Not implemented**: No metrics collection in current code
- **Variable results**: Performance varies by hardware
- **Scope creep**: Would require adding instrumentation

## 🎯 Test Additions and Decisions

### ✅ Completed

#### 1. DiskCache Refactoring
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- Moved DiskCache to private nested class in MemoryCache
- Removed all direct DiskCache tests (it's now an implementation detail)
- Implemented automatic cleanup on init, deinit, and every 100 writes
- Cleanup removes files older than 1 hour (optimized for radar image use case)
- Thread safety guaranteed by MemoryCache actor context
- DiskCache is Sendable with async file operations

### ❌ Not Implemented (With Rationale)

#### 2. Disk I/O Error Handling
**Why not tested:**
- Would require mocking FileManager or dependency injection
- Current architecture uses FileManager directly without abstraction
- Adding DI would complicate the simple, clean API
- Real disk failures are rare and handled gracefully (operations return nil)

**What we do test:**
- Deserialization errors (corrupted data)
- Missing files (return nil)
- Invalid data format

#### 3. SHA256 Hash Collisions
**Why not tested:**
- SHA256 has 2^256 possible outputs
- Probability of collision is astronomically small (1 in 10^77)
- Would require crafting specific inputs or brute force
- Not a practical concern for any real-world usage

#### 4. Directory Cleanup on Deinit
**Why not tested:**
- Timing-dependent (can't reliably test deinit)
- Would require process lifecycle management
- Cleanup is best-effort, not critical functionality
- System will clean cache directories if needed

#### 5. Performance/Stress Tests
**Why not implemented:**
- Performance varies by hardware
- Not a correctness test
- Would make test suite slow
- Better suited for separate benchmark suite

**Consider adding if:**
- Performance regression becomes a concern
- Need to compare implementations
- Have specific performance requirements

### Medium Priority

#### 3. Cache Invalidation Patterns
```swift
@Test("Remove value from cache")
func testRemoveValue() {
    // Note: Currently no remove method implemented
    // This would test cache invalidation if added
}
```

#### 4. Batch Operations
```swift
@Test("Batch set operations")
func testBatchSet() {
    // If batch operations are added in future
}
```

### Low Priority

#### 5. Logging Verification
- Verify appropriate log messages for operations
- Check error logging for failures
- Would require log capturing mechanism

#### 6. Memory Footprint Tests
- Measure memory usage with many items
- Compare NSData overhead vs raw data
- Platform-specific and variable

## Testing Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Test public API behavior
- ✅ Use async/await properly in tests
- ✅ Test error paths we can control
- ✅ Verify thread safety with concurrent tests
- ✅ Keep tests fast and deterministic

### Don'ts
- ❌ Don't test NSCache internals
- ❌ Don't rely on timing or delays
- ❌ Don't test system-level failures we can't simulate
- ❌ Don't write flaky tests that depend on system state
- ❌ Don't over-mock (it hides real issues)

## Coverage Metrics

While we don't measure code coverage percentages (they can be misleading), we ensure:
- All public methods have tests
- Error paths have tests where possible
- Common use cases are covered
- Edge cases we control are tested

## Future Considerations

If the cache implementation changes, consider testing:
1. **Custom eviction**: If we implement our own LRU
2. **Size limits**: If we add configurable cache sizes
3. **TTL**: If we add time-based expiration
4. **Metrics**: If we add hit/miss tracking
5. **Remove operations**: If we add deletion methods

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test
swift test --filter CacheTest

# Run with verbose output
swift test --verbose
```

## Contributing Tests

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing naming patterns
2. Use `@Test` attributes with descriptions
3. Keep tests focused on one behavior
4. Add to appropriate test suite
5. Document any special requirements

## Test Coverage Summary

### Current Status: ✅ Comprehensive

The test suite provides excellent coverage for:
- ✅ All public API methods
- ✅ Concurrent operations and thread safety
- ✅ Error handling we can control
- ✅ Disk persistence across instances
- ✅ Cache identifier isolation
- ✅ Edge cases (special characters, unicode, long keys)
- ✅ Protocol conformance
- ✅ 21 tests covering all major scenarios

### Intentionally Not Tested
- ❌ NSCache internals (Apple's responsibility)
- ❌ System-level failures (can't simulate reliably)
- ❌ SHA256 collisions (astronomically unlikely)
- ❌ Performance benchmarks (separate concern)
- ❌ Deinit cleanup (timing-dependent)

### Conclusion

The test suite is **production-ready** with comprehensive coverage of all testable behavior. The untested areas are either:
1. Outside our control (NSCache, system)
2. Impractical to test (SHA256 collisions)
3. Would require architectural changes that add complexity without value (DI for mocking)

This pragmatic approach ensures maintainable, reliable tests that verify actual functionality rather than implementation details.
