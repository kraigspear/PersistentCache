# PersistentCache

A thread-safe persistent cache implementation with automatic memory management and disk persistence. Built on NSCache for reliable system-integrated memory management with persistent disk storage for data durability.

## Features

- 🔒 Thread-safe implementation using Swift actors
- 📱 Built on NSCache for automatic memory management
- 🗑️ Automatic eviction based on system memory pressure
- 💾 Persistent disk storage with automatic fallback
- 📝 Comprehensive logging for debugging
- 🔐 SHA256-based disk cache file naming

## Installation

Add this package to your project using Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kraigspear/PersistentCache.git", from: "2.0.0")
]
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
// Define a cached value type
struct CachedImage: CachedValue {
    let imageData: Data
    
    // Required for serialization
    var data: Data { imageData }
    
    static func fromData(data: Data) throws -> CachedImage {
        CachedImage(imageData: data)
    }
}

// Create a cache instance
let cache = MemoryCache<String, CachedImage>()

// Store a value
let imageData = Data() // Your image data
let cachedImage = CachedImage(imageData: imageData)
await cache.set(cachedImage, for: "profile-picture")

// Retrieve a value
if let image = await cache.value(for: "profile-picture") {
    // Use the cached image
}
```

### Advanced Usage

```swift
// Check if a value exists in memory
let exists = await cache.contains("profile-picture")

// Store Data directly (Data conforms to CachedValue)
let rawData = "Hello, World!".data(using: .utf8)!
await cache.set(rawData, for: "text-data")

// Retrieve from disk if not in memory
// The cache automatically checks disk storage when a value isn't in memory
let cachedValue = await cache.value(for: "some-key")
```

## Memory Management

The cache uses NSCache which automatically handles memory pressure:
- Responds to system memory warnings
- Evicts items based on available memory
- Integrates with iOS/macOS memory management

Items persist to disk and are automatically loaded when:
- Requested items are not in memory
- The cache can restore them from disk storage

## Protocol Requirements

To store a value in the cache, it must conform to the `CachedValue` protocol:

```swift
public protocol CachedValue: Sendable {
    var data: Data { get }
    static func fromData(data: Data) throws -> Self
}
```

The protocol requires:
- `data`: Serialized representation for disk persistence
- `fromData`: Deserialization from disk storage
- `Sendable`: Thread-safety requirement for actors

Note: `Data` already conforms to `CachedValue`, so you can store raw data directly.

## Thread Safety

The cache is implemented as an actor, ensuring thread-safe access to all operations. Always use `await` when calling cache methods:

```swift
await cache.set(value, for: key)
await cache.value(for: key)
```

## Logging

The cache includes logging using `OSLog` for debugging:
- Cache operations (hits/misses)
- Disk storage operations
- Error conditions
